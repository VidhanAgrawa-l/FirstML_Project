# You're baking a cake and want to keep track of everything happening so you can remember what went well or what went wrong.

# You write notes in a notebook:
# "Started mixing ingredients at 10 AM."
# "Oops, spilled some flour!"
# "Cake is in the oven at 10:15 AM."
# "Finished baking at 11 AM. Tastes great!"
# These notes help you see:

# What steps you followed.
# Where mistakes happened (spilling flour).
# The overall process timeline.

# In programming, this notebook is called "Logging".

# What is logger.py?
# Itâ€™s like your notebook setup:

# You decide where to write your notes (console, file, or both).
# You organize the notes by importance:
# DEBUG: Small details for developers.
# INFO: General progress updates.
# WARNING: Something unusual but not broken.
# ERROR: A problem happened, but the program can continue.
# CRITICAL: Big problem! Something serious happened.


# What Happens When You Run It?
# Console Output:
